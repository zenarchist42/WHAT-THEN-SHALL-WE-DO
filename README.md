WHAT THEN SHALL WE DO

How to collectively become God

A zenarchist manifesto


What if human society as we know it were a person?


Assumptions: based on my personal relentless search for truth and meaning in the world
A.	 As above, so below. As within, so without. 
B.	The Tao is the way of nature. Nature is organized chaos. It exerts no effort, yet through it everything is done. Things opposed to the Tao tend to fail, die, and be miserable. 
C.	Karma (cause and effect) (see A). 
 
1.	A decentralized yet interconnected and interdependent group of neurons firing randomly can be viewed as a single personality (If you’re reading this in the third dimension you are probably under the assumption that you are one).
2.	Most human personalities are deluded to some level. The most common delusion is the idea that the voice inside one's head *is* the entire personality. We not only hear a voice in our head constantly, that we cannot control or shut off, but we identify entirely with it. We identify with our insanity. The inner voice is tyrannical, controlling, paralyzing, and according to the enlightened, entirely unnecessary. This view of the inner voice is not in line with the Tao. (B)
3.	Mindfulness, or paying attention objectively, helps one to realize fairly quickly that the voice inside one's head is not the same as the personality as a whole. It also helps streamline a personality's values and goals with their actions and increases life satisfaction. This streamlining is in line with the Tao. (B)
4.	A human personality can bring itself to the depths of hell: self hatred, self destruction, anger, fear, shame, alienation, suicide and harm to itself and others. At the other end of the spectrum, a personality can self actualize, even reaching states of pure bliss, tranquility, and equanimity, and compassion known as enlightenment. Enlightenment is achieved through mindfulness. Hell is achieved through mindlessness. (C)
5.	Psychedelic drugs are proven to connect parts of the brain that are not usually connected. Neurons fire with neurons in different parts of the brain that usually do not fire together. 

	a.	Psychedelic drugs accelerate karma (cause and effect). This means the effects of every thought are magnified by orders of magnitude.  Negative thoughts and atmosphere create feedback loops that develop quickly into hellish trips. Trips to hell can be extremely value to learn from if you face them head on, or they can break you if you don’t. Positive thoughts and atmosphere create feedback loops that develop quickly into healing experiences, freedom, understanding, bliss, tranquility, and even moments of enlightenment. They can even trigger spiritual awakening.
	
	b.	Psychedelic drugs catalyze neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. They can catalyze lasting personality changes with nearly unrivaled efficiency. For good or bad. The accelerated karmic effects last orders of magnitude longer than the experience.

I.	A decentralized yet interconnected and interdependent group of humans can be viewed as a meta-personality. This can be applied to any organized subgroup of society including religions, political ideologies, economic systems, fandoms, subreddits, and society as a whole. (1,A) Side note: what is a god but a meta personality?

II.	Society as a whole, when viewed as a single personality, is having a psychotic break. It is a danger to itself and others. It is experiencing conflicting desires and emotions at the same time (Multiple personalities). These desires and emotions are fighting, often to the death. It is allocating so much blood to its head that aneurisms are flooding the skull, while the rest of the body shrivels up for lack. It is constantly self harming and self sabotaging. It is consciously (at least somewhat consciously although not very) murdering the personalities of other species on planet earth. We are in the middle of a mass extinction. Luckily, worst case scenario, it appears it will kill itself off before it can destroy the personality of life on earth (Gaia if you will) as long as it continues on its current trajectory. If there was a suicide hotline for societies, this one should be on the phone. If there was a jail for societies, this one should be locked up to keep it from endangering others (by the way I'm not advocating punishment as a deterrent here).

  a.	Gaia is ill. When a human personality gets ill, a fever arises naturally to kill off the disease. (A). I think I was just spontaneously converted to a believer in synchronicity upon completing that sentence.
  
III.	Technology (especially information technology) has connected neurons of the meta brain with neurons that do not usually fire together. The entire world is more interconnected than ever before. The combination of capitalism and technology is a positive feedback loop unlike anything we’ve seen before. Society is currently tripping balls on technology. while chain smoking DMcapitalismT. (5,A). And it's a bad trip.

  a.	Technology accelerates karma (cause and effect) (A, 5a, common sense). The effects of every meta thought (action) are magnified by orders of magnitude. Negative meta thoughts (YOUR  AND MY ACTIONS) and atmosphere create feedback loops that develop quickly into hellish trips. Trips to hell can be extremely value to learn from if society faces them head on, or they can break society if it doesn’t. Positive thoughts (YOUR AND MY ACTIONS) and atmosphere create feedback loops that develop quickly into healing experiences and even moments of societal enlightenment. They can even trigger awakening… 
  
  b.	Technology. catalyzes societal neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. (A, 5b). This is evident in a society changing faster than ever. Technology, especially information technology, can catalyze lasting meta personality changes with nearly unrivaled efficiency (see the respective effects of language, written language, the sea ship, the printing press, the telegram, radio, the airplane, TV, and the internet. Notice the spacing over time). For good or bad. We can already see that the accelerated karmic effects will last orders of magnitude longer than the experience.
  
IV.	Perhaps society's biggest delusions is Hume's paradox: The power of government is derived from the consent/belief of the people, which is their ongoing decision not to overthrow it, but the people are convinced that the ruling class holds power over them. (Hume emphasizes force, but all that is required for a government to lose all power is for everyone collectively to stop believing that it has power. Force is not necessary to overthrow a government). This paradox is not in line with the Tao, or even, well common sense. (2A, B) Now go back and read (2) and (A). If this does not make you go “Aha!” out loud, read IV, 2, and A again. I sure as hell did.

V.	If mindfulness can increase the wellbeing of human personalities, the same principles will work on a meta personality (A). If mindfulness effortlessly eradicates the identification of the self with the inner voice (as it did for me the very first time I meditated), then meta-mindfulness is the solution to Hume's paradox. (I'll stop typing "A" so much as it gets redundant). As mindfulness streamlines consciousness, meta mindfulness flattens heirarchy and fertilizes Tao: Organized chaos. 
VI.	Meta mindfulness in action: exercises. 

  a.	Find out if polling on public opinion matches up to public policy. (hint: the inner voice is in charge of the polls. Many polls you see will be on issues that are important to the inner voice but not to society as a whole. many polls are prominent simply because they draw an emotional response or because they are divisive. Eyes on the big picture. HINT HINT: Start with things that are closest to unanimous agreement. HINT!!!!!!: start with public opinion on getting money out of politics). Let me know if this does not eradicate any belief you had in functioning democracy. Or a society that has streamlined its goals and values with its actions. Maybe I'll make a post with more details and sources for this.
  
  b.	Find out if society’s goals are the same as what society has determined creates happiness. Look at scientific studies of what actually makes people happy. Picture yourself asking society what it's goals are. See if the two are the same.
  
  c.	What does meta mindfulness look like to you?
  
VII.	If mindfulness can bring a human to enlightenment, meta mindfulness can bring a meta human to enlightenment. (4,A)

VIII.	People talk about singularity as if technology will bring it about. As if it is not already the nature of things. What is the meta personality of society but the singularity in the present? We collectively are the super A(b)I: artificial-biological Intelligence. A hyper intelligent schizophrenic cyborg.

IX.	**What does meta mindfulness look like?** Try to think for yourself before reading my opinion.

  a.	Technology is neither good nor bad, technology is a mirror for society. Only the mirror is shattered. How many years of bad luck is that again? To me, meta mindfulness looks like fixing the mirror.
  
  b.	To me, meta mindfulness looks like a streamlined brain. Organized chaos creating effortless mindful action. This is the way the brain works. The brain is the most complicated thing in existence, and it is barely understood. In fact when we study the brain what is happening is the brain is studying itself. Meta mindfulness is meta neuroscience. The brain is run without a throne or ruling class. It is run by nature, by organized chaos. But most are not aware of this. As far as technology has come we are nowhere near the brain. Yet we consider ourselves above nature in some made up hierarchy (they’re all made up; they don’t exist in nature unless you believe in them. Reality is what’s left when you stop believing in it). But this intellect comes from non-hierarchy. Meta mindfulness is aligning society’s brain with Tao. (B)
  
  c.	To me, meta mindfulness looks something like reddit. A constant organic polling of the population on all issues. Reddit is a beautifully organized brain. Subjects are compartmentalized into subreddits. "Thoughts" arise in subreddits, and are evaluated by the community. 
  
    1.	Now, picture an open source online constitution with a Reddit-like framework. It's a fluid constitution, constantly creating a new reality and changing to adapt to it. (This is what consciousness is. This, I believe would give it sentience). It would use blockchain voting so that any person can audit the vote if they want to, and everyone's privacy is protected. It would also be run collectively by the community using it. Each person would be a shareholder with an equal share and an equal vote.
    
    2.	How society overthrows rule by the voice inside its head, or how to get (V) to happen: Consider the Thomas Theorem: “If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.” (Basically, A+C). People define power structures as valid because they are either productive or necessary. With mindfulness of the fact that power structures as they exist are counterproductive, tyrannical, controlling, paralyzing and unnecessary, any belief in their validity is effortlessly eradicated. This is how everyone collectively stops believing in a government, currency, economic system, etc at the same time. This is how you overthrow a government and ruling class without violence.
    
      1.	By the way, I think nature rewards integrity. A community with good intentions founded on violent revolution will only result in violence. (see USSR, USA, every nation-state ever). A wise man once said, “Those who live by the sword die by the sword.” (C). This is how we achieve world peace.
      
    3.	Reddit allows the community not only to vote on issues, but to choose which issues to vote on. More than that it allows the community to prioritize issues by order of importance. Now, if Reddit were owned and managed collectively by the community using it, the community would control all of this along with the very framework the democracy rests on. This is how the online open source fluid constitution would work. This is how you put power in the hands of the people. At this point you probably have an objection like, "but not everyone wants to vote on every issue" or, "some people just don't care" or, "some things in a constitution shouldn't be constantly up for change enough to vote" or my personal objection, “reddit’s voting system just leads to circle jerks and hides any sort of criticism.” (If your objection is “some people are too dumb to vote,” then look out: you may be part of the ruling class that will be overthrown. Be mindful that you only want to replace the loudest voice in society’s head with your own). Now, imagine yourself posting your problem on the problems subconstitution and discussing until a solution is agreed upon. The system handles any problem you present it, organically, and effortlessly. This is **recursive** democracy. This is meta democracy. This is streamlining a consciousness. This is fixing the mirror. This is the singularity realizing itself. This is societal awakening. This is how we become GOD.
